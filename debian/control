Description: Runs a command periodically, showing output only when it changes
 watchng is a program that runs the given command-line periodically, showing
 the output only when it is different than the last, along with the time.
 .
 The idea is very similar to procps's watch utility - the major difference is
 that previous outputs are kept on the screen with their timestamp.
